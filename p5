### Question 5

First we subset the motor vehicles, which we assume is anything like Motor Vehicle in SCC.Level.Two.

```{r motorVehicles,cache=TRUE}
vehicles <- grepl("vehicle", SCC$SCC.Level.Two, ignore.case=TRUE)
vehiclesSCC <- SCC[vehicles,]$SCC
vehiclesNEI <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% vehiclesSCC,]
```

Next we subset for motor vehicles in Baltimore,

```{r mvBaltimore,cache=TRUE}
baltimoreVehiclesNEI <- vehiclesNEI[vehiclesNEI$fips==24510,]
```

Finally we plot using ggplot2,

```{r plot5}
library(ggplot2)
ggp <- ggplot(baltimoreVehiclesNEI,aes(factor(year),Emissions)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="grey",width=0.75) +
  theme_bw() +  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (10^5 Tons)")) + 
  labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Motor Vehicle Source Emissions in Baltimore from 1999-2008"))
print(ggp)
```

**How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?**

Emissions from motor vehicle sources have dropped from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City!
